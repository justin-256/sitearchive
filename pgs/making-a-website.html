    <p>I previously had another version, but it sucked. This one has some nice search features, and I plan on adding things like tags and groups. I made this site to document my projects, and hopefully help out anyone who happens to view it. I am not great at HTML and CSS, so the site is quite basic, but I hope it works fine. Feel free to have a look in the files, everything is static and client side!</p>
