<title>Service Analyzer Teardown</title>
<h1>Northern Telecom Central Office Service Analyzer Teardown</h1>
<p1>
    Around a month ago when browsing ebay for test equipment, I found a strange device.
    After seeing the price, I figured I would look into it. After seeing a shipping cost of 
    $120, I started to reconsider the thought of buying it. After looking it up I found no 
    info on it other than the listing itself. It was a big unit made by Northern Telecom, a 
    once very common company that is now shut down due to China stealing ideas and producing their 
    own versions. I am really interested in the company, it could be their fate 
    or the fact that it was a big Canadian company, but I knew I had to have it. 
</p1>
<p2>Because of the fact that it says “central office” and “Northern Telecom” in the title, 
    I knew I had no use for such a special piece of equipment. However, curiosity got the 
    best of me and I wanted to take it apart and see what was inside and maybe even get some 
    useful parts from it that I could use in future projects. I wanted to first know if what 
    was inside was worth the money. I figured I could get an approximation by knowing the weight. 
    After contacting the seller asking for the weight and after them responding 45 pounds, 
    I came to three conclusions: <br><br>
    1: it's full of rocks <br>
    2: there is a lot of metal <br> 
    3: FULL OF PARTS <br><br>    
    
    I decided to take the chance and ordered it. Around a week and a half later, the day before leaving to go on vacation, I got a massive box in the mail.

<p1>That's one big box!</p1>

<p3>I opened it up and after removing many pieces of packing material I got to the beast. 
    Besides the dirt and a few rusty screws, it was gorgeous! Metal knobs, sturdy enclosure, 
    beautiful buttons and potentiometers that felt amazing to turn.

    I immediately got out my screwdrivers and took the lid off. What I saw next was exactly what I was hoping to see.
    Many cards with edge connectors. All numbered.  
    Big relays. A massive Mallory capacitor bolted to the side. I didn't know where to start, so I started looking at the cards. I tried cards 4 and 5, but they wouldn't budge. But the others came out. Towards the end I pulled out a card with a battery, and considering the age of the product I knew it would be leaky. But I didn't expect colourful crystals!

<p1>What the hell happened here!?</p1>

<p5>After somehow getting it upstairs WITHOUT breaking my back, I 
    started to take it apart. I don't have any pictures as I was so 
    excited. However after I got back from vacation I started to 
    document all the boards. I took pictures of both sides. Here 
    they are: (the end has the original listing images)
